## Prompt 1
Your task is to create HTML and CSS for the HoverChair website's “hero” section. HoverChair is a hovercraft-inspired desk chair that floats slightly above the ground, providing a comfortable and exciting seating experience.

 * Ensure the code is easy to understand for non-coders by avoiding the use of complex CSS features.
 * Use an elegant and neutral color palette, with a focus on earthy tones and subdued hues.
